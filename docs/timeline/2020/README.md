Since it was not a formal collab she had her mic off and typed in Minecraft chat.

Toko was also surprised to see her since it should be her vacation.

Suisei promoted for her radio program tomorrow since Toko would be the guest.

:comet: (Still trying to fish Toko happily)

:tropical_drink: : Alright seemed like she's having a good time, might also laughing now.

Suisei also found out it had been a long while since last time she played Minecraft and already forgotten how to play.

But she still acted in a funny way and wrote diary.

#### Live performance

Toko mentioned that they want to not just *sing together*, but also *dance together*.

Suisei said her favorite part of Toko is she laugh happily a lot. Toko said Suisei also laugh a lot. Their conversations were able to keep alive for a long time and they gained a lot of common language because of this.

Suisei really like Toko's performance on Virtual to Live 2019, Toko also invited Suisei to watch the *Blu-ray* replay together at home.

#### Anemachi

Toko thought Anemachi (Suisei's elder sister) was pretty funny. Not only during the lastest collab gacha stream, Anemachi often shows up when Suisei making a long call with Toko at night. Anemachi even invited Toko to go the *Tokyo Disney Land* together.

Suisei said because of Anemachi, she also became an Otaku. Toko said well seemed like it's because of Anemachi then we can meet each other.

Toko also got an elder sister, she also got influenced by her elder sister and started to read Manga and watch animes. Same as Suisei.

#### What for meal?

Suisei and Toko often go for a meal (mainly barbecue) in 2019, before COVID-19 breakout.

Suisei always decided pretty fast since she is only interest in meat / beef.

For the next meal, they quickly decided that should be [<i class="fa-brands fa-wikipedia-w"></i> Shabushabu ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu)

#### Feeling nervous on stage?

Fan letter asked whether there were monsters on the stage (whether they would feel nervous on live concert stage), Toko and Suisei said they are more excited than nervous when seeing the audiences and the glow sticks in their hands.

Even there are, seemed like Toko would *politely eat them up* since she is the *mighty mighty Cerberus*.
