#### Announcement

That night 20:00 JST Inui Toko started her Karaoke stream and the title said *I got some announcements*.

> [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Original YouTube Stream ](https://youtu.be/Q1t_vUj-fJQ&t=2068s)

Her first announcement was *her first original song is on its way*.

The second announcement was *Inui Toko 1st solo live \"who i am\"* on Dec 10th, 2020.

The most astonishing thing was *Hoshimachi Suisei appeared as one of the live guests*. It was the first time a Hololive member appeared on Nijisanji paid event / live concert so that was a big surprise.

According to Toko, all guests (Lize Helesta, Ange Katrina, Higuchi Kaede and **Hoshimachi Suisei**) are extremely important to her and that's why she invited them to her 1st solo live.
